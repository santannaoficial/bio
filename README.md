# Hi!
### About me
I am currently attending a higher education degree at the State University of Santa Catarina UDESC for Technologist in Systems Analysis and Development, where I intend to improve my knowledge as an entrepreneur, with ability to work in teams, endowed with initiative in the proposal and implementation of the solution of problems and a spirit of cooperation and articulation.

I am a developer certified by the SENAI institution of Joinvile Santa Catarina as a Systems Development Technician since the end of 2021 and I have already carried out work as a Freelancer Designer starting in SÃ£o Paulo in 2017.
